+GUILHERME DE SANTA RITA+

Maquete em terra-cota


Guilherme de Santa Rita, que o despeito caraïba de um jornal,
no peixe-e-carne de um dos seus _+menus+_ necrologicos, apostila
jogralmente de «um dos mais entusiasticos cultores _+d'essa
coisa a que se chama para ahi o futurismo+_»,--Guilherme
de Santa Rita era por dentro e por fóra um Artista, um representante
legitimo d'essa especie de _+exilados+_, sempre ferido pelo
gume das cousas circundantes, sobrepairando numa atmosfera
de abstráções e desdens, ao mesmo tempo fálhos e complexos,
argila e chamma, que a Vida pulveriza, como as creanças malignas
as azas das borboletas.

Com a sua figura grácilmente exangue de fim de raça, com a sua
voz que ora parecia _+ter remorsos de falar+_--voz de himoptise,
a extinguir-se; ora fazia parar na rua, no mosaico dum café,
no simulacro de gruta dum _+hall+_ de exposições, onde certos
visitantes vão e veem como peixes mortos boiando á flôr d'agua
duma piscina,--fazia deter, com timbres angulosos de cristaes
a partir-se, anatomias ruminantes de bons-senhores _+effarés+_; com
o seu perfil de caule em que as andainas-sacos de _+kappelmeister_
maniaco, _+acintosamente+_ mal aprumadas, evocavam cerimoniaes
mysticos de catafalco; com os seus cabelos dum castanho tranzido
de escuro, dir-se-iam molhados sobre a fronte dum palôr de camelia
branca, como aves da noite que congelassem contra uma estatua
de ephebo num jardim; com os seus gestos hiperinquietos, estridentes,
chariváricos, _+ilustrando+_ os dialogos com a vertigem dum
Claude Monet fixando na téla o bailado loïe-fulleresco dos
tons;--Santa Rita era a demonstração viva, a contraprova faiscante
deste aforismo de Baudelaire: «_on peat vivre trois jours sans
pain, mais on ne peut passer um jour sans poésie.+_»

Quem uma vez tocasse o tubernaculo da sua intimidade, aceitasse
o convite que elle cavalheirescamente fazia para um _+passeio
d'Arte+_ por entre as acacias da Avenida, nalgum entardecer
de láca de Florença ou, ás noites, quando os ventos ulúlam
os seus leit-motivos de pavor, forçosamente havia de reconhecer
que calcurreava a par d'_+alguem+_ muito diferente do _+homo
vulgaris+_, «saco de comida» que Vinci lançou ás feras dos
seus sarcasmos teogónicos e n'este paiz dos ceus de porcelana,
patria bem amada da mesmice, os _+aristos das letras+_ reeditam;
d'_+alguem+_ que nos dominios da Emoção e do Pensamento os
fados sagraram gran-senhor e que era como uma antêna plurivibratil,
halucinatoria, aonde prendiam todos os fios de todas as
exquisitezes da sensibilidade moderna.

AVENIDA DA LIBERDADE




Elle era, como quase todos os espiritos _+ineditos+_, um
intoxicado d'Arte, possesso da necessidade de drapejar aos quatro
ventos a toxina que o esperecia. Razão porque muitos dos seus
conhecidos o achavam extravagante, bizarro e manifestavam ante
a sua expansibilidade radiosa o espanto colerico da mosca que
não pode atravessar a placa flamejante dum vitral _+e não sabe
porquê+_.

Que fôsse possivel existir quem nesse asylo da mendicidade
que é, em Lisbôa, a chamada «roda» dos intelectuaes, estalactites
de café, onde a sua inteligencia, uma vez ou outra condescendia
em aparecer, talvez para se documentar sobre não sei que
humoristica compilação dos usos e costumes dos fósseis,--que
fôsse possivel existir quem, entre os _+superiores e idealistas+_,
dispensasse _+la poésie+_ nas 24 horas chloroticas ou congestivas
do dia-a-dia, eis contra que Santa Rita protestava com as mais
agudas das suas interjeições, agitando em elypses de mófa os
longos dedos piciolados de violinista tisico, os seus dedos
de bôa linhagem, cheios de expressão, vozeantes d'alma, feitos,
como os de Jean Lorrain, para o ritual luminico das joias...

E nada mais divertido do que assistir então aos esforços
dos sapos tentando alcandorar-se aos cimos em que o meu
querido pintor goticisava vôos. Inestimaveis melharucos
de sonetos lusitanos, poedôres mecanicos de versos coloristas,
mais ignorantes do que cavalariços, querendo vêr no analfabetismo
a marca da originalidade e com desdens de guardas-portões
pelos que estudam; prosadores de noticias d'annos; pinturrécos
sem paleta, que enchem os _+godets+_, quando muito de anilina;
rodins de farinha triga, que quando fazem _+bonzos+_ pretendem
que os aceitêmos como _+bronzes+_ e quando contornam musculos
sugerem apenas meias-gravidezes... ah, como toda esta companha
de surdos-mudos do espirito, se não adergava convencê-lo
de que não dispensava _+o tal ideal+_, tirava depois a feminil
vingança, tratando-o de maluco e de lunatico, em conciliabulos
de mastins!

«Guilherme de Santa Rita estudou em Paris como pensionista
do Estado», tagarela um ganimedes de _+folha d'alface+_.

Parabens, seu compadre!

Deixou Santa Rita, como pintor, alguma obra de peso, um
consideravel quadro, uma insexual _+pochade+_, a famosa maquina
pictural, em summa, de horroroso estylo _+pompier+_, que tanto
repugnava á sua apurada estesia e para cuja execução o Estado
o pensionava?

Não, amigos. De resto, dispersava força neurica demais em projectos
maravilhosos, em concepções imprevistas, em imaginações faúlhantes
para poder materialisar o que projectava, o que concebia, o que
imaginava.

Diz ali, na minha estante, o _+Homem de genio obscuro+_, de Fialho: «_Entre
a intrepidez dos meus ideaes artisticos e a mesquinharia dos meus
recursos picturaes, ha um abysmo de impotencia de que não quero
dar prova aos meus contemporaneos.+_»

E ouço a voz de Oscar Wilde, seu vizinho de prateleira,
a responder-lhe, com esse gesto de desencanto apolineo,
tão perverso, que punha azas de grifo no lirismo azul dos
seus olhos: «_Voulez-vous savoir, dear, le grand drame de ma
vie?--C'est que j'ai mis mon génie dans ma vie; je n'ai mis
que mon talent dans mes œuvres+_».

O seu culto entusiastico por _+essa coisa a que se chama
para ahi o futurismo+_!

Encantadoras irreverencias da inepcia!


       *       *       *       *       *


Uma noite, na _+brasserie+_ do Largo de Santa Justa, esperavamos
ambos, com duas conservadoras chavenas de café, ver surgir
a silhueta eminentemente caracteristica do Fernando Pessôa,
em que se justapõem e quase se intersécionam bem inequivocas
reminiscencias da velha Mademoiselle, da _+Germinie Lacerteux_
e do Adrien Sixte, de Bourget.

Santa Rita, fixos em mim, anciosamente, os seus olhos de
pedra preciosa, tinha-me revelado já a sua adoração pelo futurista
hespanhol Picassso; esse Bonaparte da _+réclame+_, grande industrial
do Genio; de Severini, de Boccioni, de Russolo, do seu admiravel
quadro _+A Revolta+_, verdadeira epopeia paroxistica do Movimento,
toda em _+linhas-forças+_ de uma intensidade jamais egualada, de
Robert Delaunay e das suas _+planches+_ tão ruivamente _+réussies+_; das
predilecções futuristas, evidentes no ultimo livro d'essa bacchante
scénica de D'Annunzio, _+Forse che si, forse che no+_, duma
fantasia rica de tapete d'Oriente... Eu, que lêra na vespera
os _+manifestos+_ de Marinetti, extasiava-me ante a frase celebre,
archetypica desse rapsôdo presciente do _+Hoje+_ dinamico da Arte: «Um
automovel de aluguel é mais formoso que a _+Victoria de Samotracia+_.»

Mas Fernando Pessôa não aparecia a dar-nos o _+bonbon fondant_
da sua conversa, tão eleganciada de flexuosidades mentaes,
perspectivando ceus typhicos de inauditismos, como a dum
Walter Pater que praticasse a horoscopia...

Já na despedida:--até ámanhã--, um de nós lançou o nome
de Paul Cézanne, o _+precursor+_ odiado e vilependiado.

Meu pobre Santa Rita!

Neste momento em que tento em vão, com a greda das palavras,
esculpir o teu perfil na memoria dos que te estimaram e
procuro, para o completar, na galeria dolorosa dos teus
Antepassados do Pincel, um equivalente do teu espirito
e da tua emoção,--é o nome de Paul Cézanne que pronuncio.
Como elle, Christo resignado do insuccesso, vêjo-te morrendo,
na ante-manhã da existencia, entre os chascos vermelhos
da canalha.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
