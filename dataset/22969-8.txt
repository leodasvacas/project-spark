LIGA NAVAL DE LISBOA


Em Portugal existe uma unica opinião sobre Arte e abrange uma tão
colossal maioria que receio que ella impere por esmagamento. Essa
opinião é a do Ex.^mo sr. dr. José de Figueiredo (gago do governo).

Não é porque este snr tenha opinião nem que este snr seja da igualha
do resto de Portugal mas o resto de Portugal e este senhor em materia
de opinião são da mesma igualha. Um dia um senhor grisalho disse-me em
meia-hora os seus conhecimentos sobre Arte. Quando acabou a meia-hora
descobri que os conhecimentos do senhor grisalho sobre Arte eram os
mesmos que o Ex.^mo senhor Dr. José de Figueiredo usava para me pedir
um tostão. [1] Pensa o leitor que faço a anedocta? Antes fôsse. Mas a
verdade é que eu estou muito triste com esta furia de incompetencia
com que Portugal participa na Guerra Europeia. E que horrôr, caros
compatriotas, deduzir experimentalmente que de todas as nossas
Conquistas e Descobertas apenas tenha sobrevivido a Imbecilidade. E
daqui a indiferença espartilhada da familia portugueza a convalescer
á beira-mar. Algumas das raras energias mal comportadas que ainda
assômam à tôna d'agua pertencem halucinadamente a seculos que já não
existem e quando Um Portuguez, genialmente do seculo XX, desce da
Europa, condoído da patria entrévada, para lhe dar o Parto da sua
Intelligencia, a indiferença espartilhada da familia portugueza ainda
não deslaça as mãos de cima da barriga. Pois, senhores, a Exposição de
Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso na Liga Naval de Lisboa é o documento conciso
da Raça Portugueza no Seculo XX.

[1] Rectifico:--O Ex.^mo Snr Dr. José de Figueiredo veio substituir no
original um Ex.^mo Snr. que tem por habito pedir-me tostões.

A Raça Portugueza não precisa de rehabilitar-se, como pretendem pensar
os tradicionalistas desprevenidos; precisa é de nascer pró século em
que vive a Terra. A Descoberta do Caminho Maritimo prá India já não nos
pertence porque não participamos d'este feito fisicamente e mais do que
a Portugal este feito pertence ao seculo XV.

Nós, os futuristas, não sabêmos Historia só conhecêmos da Vida que
passa por Nós. Elles teem a Cultura, Nós temos a Experiencia--e não
trocâmos!

Mais do que isto ainda Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso pertence á Guarda
Avançada nA MAIOR DAS LUCTAS que é o Pensamento Universal.

Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso é a primeira Descoberta de Portugal na Europa
no seculo XX. O limite da Descoberta é infinito porque o sentido da
Descoberta muda de substancia e cresce em interesse--por isso que a
Descoberta do Caminho Maritimo prá India é menos importante que a
Exposição de Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso na Liga Naval de Lisboa.

Felizmente pra ti, leitor, que eu não sou critico, razão porque te não
chateio com elucidações da Arte de que estás tão longinquamente
desprevenido; mas ámanhã, quando já soubéres que o valor de Amadeo de
Souza-Cardoso é o que eu te digo aqui, terás remorsos de o não têres
sabido hontem. Portanto, começa já hoje, vae á Exposição na Liga Naval
de Lisboa, tápa os ouvidos, deixa correr os olhos e diz lá que a Vida
não é assim?

Não esperes, porém, que os quadros venham ter comtigo, não! Elles teem
um prégo atraz a prendê-los. Tu é que irás ter com elles. Isto leva 30
dias, 2 mezes, 1 anno mas, se tem prazo, vale a pêna sêres persistente
porque depois saberás tambem onde está a Felicidade.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
