DUAS PALAVRAS DO AUCTOR


_A morte do joven portuense João Alvares d'Almeida Guimarães foi perda mui
real e consideravel não sómente para a sua familia e amigos, mas ainda para
o ensino público e para a litteratura. Unia elle bom cabedal de talentos a
bem fornecido peculio d'instrucção bebida em salutares mananciaes; por
quanto a mais leve mácula d'irreligião, a mais esvaida tinctura de cynismo,
lhe eram sobejo motivo para abandonar começadas leituras, e romper toda a
communicação com auctores eivados de similhante lepra, e que, na esperança
talvez de mais avultados lucros ou de maior celebridade, inculcam theorias
que a experiencia desmente, ou lisonjeam paixões que muito conviria
refrear. Joven nos annos, ancião na prudencia, não pagava fôro á
presumpçosa insania d'um seculo legitimador de todas as illegitimidades,
atrozmente corrupto e corruptor. Todavia recatava este joven suas raras
virtudes e preciosos talentos sob o véo da natural modestia; e por isso,
para ser bem avaliado, havia mister conhecido e tractado de perto. Coube-me
essa dita, e são para mim de saudosa recordação tantas noites que passamos
embebidos em serio estudo, ou, por vezes, em colloquio amigavel. Quando em
mim a fragil natureza ceder ás instigações da vaidade, exclamarei na fôrça
do meu enthusiasmo: João Alvares d'Almeida Guimarães foi meu discipulo e
amigo!_




A SAUDADE.




A SAUDADE.

CANTO ELEGIACO.

    Celasti alti desir sotto umil verte;
    Negasti albergo ai torti umani affetti:
    Non so s'angel terreno, od uom celeste!

                            L. Guidiccioni.


Teus arcanos, ó Deus, se ao mundo roubas
Assim tam cedo um exemplar prestante,
Nunca os penetrará sciencia humana,
Por mais lucubrações que accesa aguante.

Eira espaçosa despojar do trigo,
E ingrato joio estreme só deixar-lhe,
Ah! é mysterio que gemendo adoro,
E a ti compete a profundez palpar-lhe.

Quanto nos foge rapida ésta vida,
Esta folha autumnal que, exposta ao vento,
Entre o ser e o não ser definha inutil,
Se na seiva moral não tem sustento!

Altos decretos teus!... Mas ah! permitte,
Permitte um ai, Senhor, á natureza;
Que inda o vibrado golpe me resôa
No fundo d'alma, abysmo de tristeza.

Teu Filho associou lagrymas suas
Ás lagrymas de Martha e de Maria,
E acordou-lhes o irmão, que sob a lagem
Ferreo somno de morte já dormia.

E não chorarei eu?... A dor, o pranto,
São legado fatal que remanece
Imposto por Adão á prole infausta;
Só do stoico a vaidade o desconhece.

Pela etherea amplidão agora estende
Seu negro manto a noite taciturna,
E me vê, n'este aos mortos grato asylo,
Cingir d'affecto veneranda urna.

N'ella jaz (só extincto coube n'ella)
Um coração magnanimo, que todo
A sabor seu formaram as Virtudes,
Quasi sem liga de terreno lôdo!

Sim, Jonelio em seu peito recatava
Sublime coração, alma sublime,
Velados de modestia amplos thesouros
De que o valor em vozes mal se exprime.

Era lampada accesa reluzindo,
Sem nunca esmorecer, no templo sancto;
Era em ferrenha quadra eximio athleta
D'aureas doutrinas, que prezava tanto.

Ás suggestões do seculo enganosas
Oppunha alta prudencia inabalavel;
E amando os homens, pesaroso via
O imperio das paixões crescer duravel.

Ai! perdeu n'elle a patria exemplo e esfôrço
Que ao vicio a torpe audacia abateriam,
E o banido pudor aos lusos lares,
Em pompa triumphal, restituiriam.

Fida amizade em vínculo pujante
Ha muito os corações nos enlaçava;
Era qual fonte em aridos desertos
Jonelio para mim, quando o avistava.

Preceptor me escolheu para aplanar-lhe
As sendas da moral philosophia,
E não sei qual de nós lucrou mais luzes
No mutuo engôdo da tenaz porfia.

Doces momentos!... suspirado amigo!...
Não mais me alegrará vossa presença
N'este de mágoas lamentoso valle,
Onde sopra tufões discórdia infensa.

Inda um amplexo ás venerandas cinzas,
Em memoria d'instantes que voaram;
Aqueça nova lagryma fervente
Despojos que do justo aqui ficaram.

Oh! que entre os braços meus anciosos sinto
A urna estremecer!... surgir de dentro
Se me affigura luminoso joven!...
E ei-lo de rosea nuvem toma o centro!

A dos Eleitos bonançosa dita
Lhe resplende nos olhos, no semblante;
E mais alvas que a neve as soltas vestes
Lhe bafeja a da noite aura fragrante.

Sua augusta missão confortadora
Já no sorriso angelico assignala;
Ergue os olhos ao céo, desce-os á terra,
E em dulcissimas vozes assim falla:

"Do exilio os dias encurtar-me aprouve
"Ao Rei que, lá do solio permanente,
"Governa os orbes, e os abrange todos
"Co' a veladora dextra omnipotente.

"Louvor ao Rei dos reis! que auxilios grandes,
"No breve espaço em que habitei a terra,
"Me liberalisou;--domei com elles
"Paixões que em peito humano ateam guerra.

"Que é sem Deus o mortal?--misero verme
"Vaso de turbação, d'iniquidade,
"Infeliz n'ésta vida transitoria,
"Inda mais infeliz na eternidade.

"Se me has visto cumprir deveres d'homem
"Se inda a memoria minha ahi se exalta,
"Dou, amigo, ao meu Deus perennes graças
"Elle a planta amparou de vigor falta.

"O das misericordias brando orvalho,
"Sôbre imperfeições minhas gotejando,
"As lavou, as deliu. Respiro glória,
"Eternos bens a flux saboreando!

"Nao ha lingua nem voz que exprimir possam
"Pullulantes riquezas infinitas
"Que me arrebatam, que em redor me alongam
"Fulgente oceano d'ineffaveis ditas!

"O martyr da verdade, o que meus passos
"No caminho alentava da virtude,
"Me seguiu pressuroso, e me é consocio
"Agora na suprema beatitude.

"Vou prostrar-me ante o Eterno, supplicar-lhe
"Que solte do destêrro e una commigo
"Minha familia, que enluctada geme;--
"Nem me esqueço de ti, saudoso amigo!

"D'essa escura mansão tumultuosa
"Ás celestes mansões voei ligeiro,
"E colheu-me affagando idéas tuas
"O inopinado instante derradeiro.

Assim falla, e volatil s'esvaece
Como nevoa d'estio ao sol nascente.
Ia abraçá-lo,--e achei entre meus braços
Da urna o frio marmore sómente.

Mas todo não findára aqui o enlêvo:
Inda roseo clarão me circumdava,
E prazenteira a viração da noite
Em affago e perfume s'esmerava.

Canto arrebatador, delicias d'alma,
Taes sons em tôrno resoar fazia:
"Vive o justo no céo, do justo as preces
"São ante o Eterno d'efficaz valia.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with

opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
