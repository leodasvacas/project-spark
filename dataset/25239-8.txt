                                                               Meus amigos


Annuindo ao convite para tomar parte do sarau litterario do dia 8 de maio,
recitei a poesia que vai lêr-se, e vós applaudindo-a indulgentemente,
desejastes possuil-a.

Publicando hoje essa modesta composição, satisfaço o vosso desejo e cumpro
um dever, prestando a minha singella homenagem ao Richelieu portuguez, ao
nosso maior vulto politico do seculo passado.

Guilherme d'Azevedo--o distincto e chorado escriptor, esse astro de
primeira grandeza ha pouco eclypsado no ceu da nossa litteratura, disse do
Epico:

«A verdadeira homenagem a Camões ou se paga com uma epopeia ou com um ponto
de admiração!

«Julgo preferivel que o meu humilde nome subscreva antes esta segunda prova
de respeito. Terá feito uma obra mais duradoura, e, sobretudo, muito mais
incontestavel!»

Eu, plagiando aquella phrase tão conceituosa, direi o mesmo de Pombal. Um
ponto de admiração seria uma homenagem mais duradoura e incontestavel do
que esse punhado de alexandrinos, que, ousadamente, vou sugeitar ao bisturi
da critica.

Que ella leve ao menos em conta a humildade do meu nome, que ha pouco tempo
ainda firma, nas columnas ignoradas de jornaes de provincia e nas paginas
dos almanachs, umas quadras massudas de um lyrismo piégas.

Valença--Maio--1882.

                                                                   _A. M._




I

De joelhos heroes! Baixai a fronte altiva,
Que passa triumphante, aureolada e viva
A sombra d'outro heroe!--a luzitana gloria
Que ha um seculo morreu para viver na Historia.

É cedo inda talvez para a consagração;
Não 'stão extintas já as luctas da paixão;
E a treva--a emulação--debate-se na liça,
Emquanto não raiar o dia da Justiça.

Mas vós, a mocidade, a esperança do Futuro,
Que altivos caminhaes, com passo bem seguro,
Na senda gloriosa e ardua do Progresso;
Vós, que haveis de lançar ao solo do Universo
A semente feraz da grande Idèa-Nova,
Deveis ajoelhar perante aquella cóva,
Que encobre veneranda a ossada do gigante
Que ha um seculo cahiu em lucta triumphante.

Ide!... ide ensinar ás gerações vindouras
Que ha paginas de luz que são immorredouras
Na historia das Nações!
                        Dizei a vossos filhos,
Que estão calcados já os gloriosos trilhos
Que hão-de conduzir ao fundo de seu peito
A força da Justiça e a força do Direito!


II

A noite tenebrosa, a noite dos horrores,
Estendia feroz as suas negras cores
Sobre a Europa abatida e sobre a terra inteira;
Apenas o clarão sinistro da fogueira
Illuminava a custo aquella triste scena;
Sentia-se um rumor como o rugir da hyena,
Havia um cheiro forte e acre e nauseabundo
Subindo em espiraes pelo azul profundo;
A carne a crepitar!.. Os gritos lancinantes!..
Como orgia infernal de velhos Corybantes!

Uma sombra indecisa, impavida e soturna
Fluctuava ali á viração nocturna;
Era a sombra do Mal--o negro pavilhão
Que tinha escripto em sangue um lemma: Religião!
E sobre cada corpo, e sobre esses destroços.
Conjuncto informe e nú de carnes e de ossos,
Andavam a pairar abutres esfaimados,
Despedaçando ainda os membros trucidados!

Humildes, evocavam o nome de Jesus,
--O nome da Justiça, o explendor, a Luz;
Traziam n'uma mão um velho Breviario;
A outra segurava o facho incendiario,
Um Christo sobre o peito, aos hombros uma estola...

Era a turba feroz dos filhos de Loyolla.

Portugal acordou, emfim, do seu lethargo;
Esgotára de todo o calix mais amargo.

Um homem, um gigante, um genio portentoso
Erguera-se de pé, n'um brado poderoso,
E disse sem temor áquellas turbas vis.

«Hyenas! recolhei ao fundo dos covis!
Largai a vossa presa, oh tigres sanguinarios!
De joelhos, chacaes! malditos salafrarios!
Hei-de lavar com sangue o sangue da Innocencia,
Matar-vos como cães, matar-vos sem clemencia,
E arrojar, porfim, ás fauces do abysmo,
Os vossos corpos nús e o vosso Fanatismo...

«A verdadeira Fé succede à Hypocrisia;
A Noite terminou, reaparece o Dia!»

E o braço poderoso e forte de Pombal
Arrebatou da treva o velho Portugal,
Para lançar a Luz, para lançar a Gloria,
Sobre elle, que era só recordação na Historia.

Exhausto e abatido ao sopro da desgraça,
Vergado ao Fanatismo--esse tufão que passa
E tenta destruir os brilhos da Rasão--
Sentia emmurchecer na sua heroica mão
Os louros que colhêra ao sol de cem batalhas.
Calára-se o canhão; o fumo das metralhas
Ja não tostava a tez aos bravos defensores
De Diu e de Malaca!
                    Esses conquistadores
Que tinham offuscado o nome de Veneza,
Que tinham concebido a audaciosa empresa,
--Na febre do valor, febre de triumphar,--
De avassalar a terra e submetter o mar;
Esse povo de heroes, titanico, indomavel,
Que dera ao mundo leis e fôra inconquistavel,
Já não queria colher da Heroicidade a palma.

Elle cuidava só... na salvação da Alma!


III

As gloriosas naus, as naus conquistadoras,
Que levavam no tópe as quinas vencedoras,
Traficavam agora o oiro, os diamantes,
O topazio, o rubi, os limpidos brilhantes,
Que outr'ora o Oriente e hoje o Novo-Mundo
Lançavam sem cessar do seu ventre fecundo!

E todo esse thesouro, e toda essa riqueza,
Era p'ra abastecer a perdularia meza
D'essa turba fradesca--a turba de vadios,
Que não passavam fome e não passavam frios,
Emquanto cá por fóra os tristes proletarios,
Famintos, rotos, nús, sem pão e sem salarios,
Iam implorar ás portas dos conventos
As migalhas servis dos fartos alimentos!

Um rei fraco, imbecil, um rei dissipador,
Assim, à imitação do Rei--Inquisidor,
Lançava essa riqueza aos tigres de roupeta,
Que tinham branca a face e a Consciencia preta.

Em vez de edificar escholas e hospitaes,
Surgiam contrucções athleticas, brutaes,
Que erguiam ao Azul, ao seio do Infinito,
As torres collossaes, gigantes de granito.


IV

Pombal surgiu, emfim, e encetou a lucta,
Heroica, gigantesca, audaz e resoluta,
Que havia de firmar a nossa autonomia,
E á Europa mostrar que era chegado o dia
Em que, aniquillada a negra Reacção,
O velho Portugal tornava a ser Nação.

A Industria floresceu e a Arte resurgiu;
O commercio acordou; de novo se cobriu
A vastidão do mar do nosso pavilhão,
Que ia transplantar a Civilisação
E levar aos confins de todo esse Universo
O nome Portuguez, extincto e submerso!

Depois, deixando assim firmado com ardencia
O acrisolado amor da nossa independencia,
Esse homem genial, espirito gigante,
Lançou o seu olhar ainda mais distante:
Reformou a Instrucção--o foco da Verdade
Que póde approximar o Genio á Divindade.

Um dia--horrivel dia!--um rude cataclysmo
Lançou uma cidade ao seio do abysmo.
D'essa terra gentil, que se chamou Lisboa,
Só restava um montão que fuma e se esborôa!..

Pouco tempo depois erguia-se imponente
A nova capital, mais bella e mais ridente...

Calêmos-nos agora!.. Ha-de-se admirar!..
Porque a nossa razão não sabe explicar
Gomo é que um braço sò podesse, sem canceira,
Alevantar do pó uma cidade inteira!


V

Injusta muita vez, a Critica, ingloria,
Quer negar-lhe um logar no pantheon da Historia,
Chamando-lhe cruel, carrasco de mil vidas,
A elle, que remiu as raças opprimidas,
Que deu à escravidão a carta de alforria,
Apontando ao Porvir da Liberdade o dia!

E se elle teve, emfim, manchas ensanguentadas,
Tambem o sol as tem, que ficam offuscadas,
Pela irradiação da sua luz brilhante...

Está limpo o pedestal da estatua do gigante!
Elle foi da Justiça o braço vingador,
Como depois na França os homens do Terror.

Saudai-o Mocidade! Um brado bem seguro,
Apostolos da Luz, videntes do Futuro!
Vós, que saudastes já o genio de Camões,
Erguei-lhe um monumento em vossos corações.
É justo que façais dupla consagração:
--Ao genio da Epopeia e ao genio da Instrucção!

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
