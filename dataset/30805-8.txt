ODE.


    Ó Tu do Ethereo Jove Irmaõ potente,[1]
    Supremo Pai das humidas Deidades, * ...
    Que manejas terrifico tridente,
    Que dominas as mesmas tempestades,
    Tu que todas as gentes senhoreas
    Na procellosa, nivea, vasta herança, * ...
    Que os cavallos maritimos enfreias,
    Distinguindo a tormenta da bonança,
    Levanta sobre o Pélago profundo
    A limosa cabeça, e vinga o Mundo.

    Sacrílegos Tipheos,[2] que conspirados
    Sem respeito a coriscos tortuosos
    Sobre os Orbes voluveis, e sagrados
    Intentastes alçarvos ambiciosos,
    Nos raios crepitantes destruidos,
    Em castigo do cego atrevimento,
    De pérfidos ingratos, e atrevidos
    Contra o supremo Deos do Firmamento,
    Vêde a outros Tipheos;[3] delicto insano!
    Que empunhaõ armas sobre o largo Oceano.

    De Inexoraveis filhos circulada
    Aligera mulher[4] cega, e robusta,
    De Mercurio nas Artes educada * ...
    Ah que tudo extremece, tudo assusta!
    Dos bens alheios ávidas Arpias,[5]
    Das cavernas Estygias povoadoras,
    Tristes imagens só de tyrannias,
    Dos maiores insultos aggressoras
    Vaõ atacar na liquida corrente
    A nadante morada, a inerme gente.

    Já as nocturnas aves vaõ pascendo
    Com os bicos de ferros aguçados;
    Nos quentes corações satisfazendo
    Os vís desejos nunca saciados:
    Aos tristes palpitantes destruidos
    Calcaõ os pés immundos, e cruentos,
    De huns resoaõ inda alguns gemidos,
    Outros de todo já não tem alentos:
    He tudo confusaõ, tudo agonia,
    Que encobre a noite, té que chega a dia.

    Aos maniatados corpos traspassando
    Do silencio nocturno a amiga turba,
    Que se farta no sangue miserando,
    E o socego do publico perturba,
    Huns entregaõ o peito ao golpe duro,
    Sem remedio saõ outros aprehendidos;
    Huns escolhem o mar por mais seguro,
    Outros escapaõ sim, mas escondidos;
    Este cahe, outro expira, aquelle geme,
    Correm rios de sangue, e tudo treme.

    Com este pezo as aguas se incurvaraõ,
    E Neptuno apôs delle, logo erguendo
    A lança triplicada, se avistaraõ
    Em sanguentadas ondas decorrendo;
    As formosas Nereidas[6] lhe assistiaõ,
    As crystallinas lagrimas limpando,
    E os ligeiros Delfins tristes corriaõ,
    Com mil ordens a Eolo[7] decretando:
    Os Euros[8] sibilantes quiesceraõ;
    Boreas, e Aquilões emmudecêraõ.

    Torpe, execrando, barbaro, incontrito,
    Em vaõ, em vaõ procuras asylarte,
    Pois que a culpa em sagrado he hum delito,
    Que o sagrado naõ deve perdoarte:
    Elle te guardará por criminoso,
    E os mesmos elementos conjurados
    Faraõ o teu supplicio tormentoso,
    Por crimes nunca de outros cogitados:
    Caso de horror, de susto, magoa, e pranto,
    Que ás mesmas féras causaria espanto!

    Oh que incuravel mal! Oh que fadiga
    Com diligencia insana procurada,
    Que a homens contra homens volve, e obriga,
    E que faz a Republica turbada!
    Grande fome, alta sede do Thesouro,
    Que motivas o odio, a vil surpreza,
    Só por fartarte hydropica no ouro,
    Atropellando as leis da natureza!
    De immortal fome, ah Tantalo[9] ambicioso,
    Tanto mais farto, quanto mais sequioso!

    Vem ó filha do Ceo, de Themis filha,[10]
    Que nascendo do Ceo, ao Ceo tornaste,
    Em cuja maõ direita a espada brilha,
    E na esquerda equilibrios ensinaste;
    Dispoem golpes mortaes, golpes sensiveis,
    Contra os filhos da terra, vís, cruentos,
    Monstros da tyrannia os mais terriveis,
    Dignos de alto castigo, altos tormentos;
    Corta filha de Jove[11] a iniquidade,
    Tanto delicto, insulto, e crueldade.

    Já os ferreos grilhões, grilhões pezados
    Arrastraõ os crueis insultadores,
    Já ficaõ comprehendidos, e accusados
    Do delicto maior, culpas maiores;
    Confessos, maniatados, e arguidos
    Gemem, debaixo dos mais justos pezos,
    A certeza de serem percutidos,
    O tormento de serem Réos, e prezos,
    De pagarem as vidas tantos damnos
    Para maior horror dos deshumanos.

    Olhai crueis a sorte do tormento,
    Que naõ tem proporção com tal insulto,
    Assim como differe do cruento
    O justo coração,[12] o mesmo indulto.
    Ide, ide pagar feios delictos,
    E ser nos altos póstes presentados;
    Naõ incautos, sem tempo, inda que afflictos,
    Com culpa, com favor, e preparados;
    Vêde, vêde o que póde a alta Piedade,
    Inda quando castiga a víl maldade.

    A maõ mimosa,[13] e Regia, junta ao peito
    O coração mostrando mais piedoso,
    Cheio de luz, e cheio de respeito,
    De hum semblante purissimo, e formoso,
    Que espalha sobre todos a riqueza,
    Rios de Graça, mil preciosidades;
    A maior exemplar de alta grandeza,
    Que honra o sacro Throno, e as Magestades,
    He, quem fez castigar o impio roubo,
    Quem nos fez libertar do voraz lobo.[14]

    Venturosa Ulysséa, ergue o rosto,
    E beija a sacra Maõ, que em nós derrama
    O socego, a fortuna, a paz, e o gosto,
    Huma chamma de amor, e outra chamma;
    Affina, a aurea lyra, e teus louvores
    Cheguem aos Ceos voluveis, estrellados,
    Cujo supremo Author lhe dá favores,
    E por ella nos faz felicitados
    Por ella, que virtudes mil encerra,
    Que premeia a virtude, e o vicio aterra.




PROTESTAÇAÕ.


Protesto, que como filho da Santa Igreja Romana, me sujeito aos
preceitos da Fé, e da Religiaõ Catholica, e que as palavras Mythologicas
desta composiçaõ Poetica saõ ornatos da Poesia, e naõ verdades della.

_Defronte da Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Gloria em casa do Author se
vendem todas as suas obras._


    [1] Neptuno filho de Saturno, Irmaõ de Jove, e Deos dos Mares.

    [2] Tipheos, saõ os Gigantes filhos da terra, que
    pertenderaõ fazer guerra a Jupiter.

    [3] Aqui se tomaõ pelos aggressores da culpa nos Dominios
    de Neptuno.

    [4] A ambiçaõ dos Réos.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
