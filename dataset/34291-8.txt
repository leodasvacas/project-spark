QUANTO BASTA A RESPEITO

DO

DIA 25 DE ABRIL DE 1828.


Não he possivel sofrer por mais tempo as injurias, e despreso com que os
suspeitissimos na Sagrada Causa da Legitimidade d'EL-REY Nosso Senhor
tem tratado o maravilhoso passo, dado no Memoravel Dia 25 de Abril de
1828 para a Sua Feliz Acclamação; e não será necessario, que a penna
cance quando della partem facilmente os bastantes rasgos para destruir a
máscara da prudencia, que não deixava apparecer semblantes atraiçoados.

Ou o Facto do Dia 25 he irregular, e abominavel nos seus Effeitos; ou
elle tem Modelos em a nossa Historia, e he respeitavel pela sua
Consequencia. O Facto he irregular, mas tem Modelos em 1139 por Affonso
I., em 1385 por João I., e em 1640 por João IV. Não he abominavel, antes
abençoado nos seus Effeitos, e respeitavel na sua Consequencia: Logo, o
Facto he digno de louvor, e hum documento para a Historia Patria, que
deixará eterna a memoria da mais deliberada Lealdade de huma tão
benemerita Capital.

Não he novo, que homens depravados appelidem por indignidade o mais
Heroico Feito. Lord Lundsdown, discipulo de Canning, atreveo-se
publicamente a comparar a Restauração de Portugal com a emancipação das
Americas rebeldes, tendo por Agentes Bolivar, e Victoria.

O Senhor D. Affonso I., o Senhor D. João I., e o Senhor D. João IV.
forão Acclamados antes da reunião dos Estados. Os Fidalgos então o
fizerão, por que o quizerão; mas por que huma parte delles agora o não
quiz, deve condemnar-se o que se fez? Então combinárão-se a sustentar os
Seus Novos, e Preciosos Soberanos: hoje fogem, e atacão os mesmos
principios que _então vigorárão_; e he isto boa fé?

Dizem as Côrtes, convocadas pelo Senhor D. João IV., que só nellas
reside o poder de Julgar a quem a Coroa pertence de direito, todas as
vezes, que se suscita duvida _entre os Pertendentes_: Mas! Lisboa não
vio, que o Senhor D. MIGUEL _pertendesse_ a Coroa: vio, que, possuido de
huma nunca vista Modestia, recebia as Supplicas, e Autos dos Povos, e
não Havia por bem Deliberar-Se. Neste caso o grito de Lisboa obriga a
Representar; a Representação obriga a Decidir; a Decisão obriga a
Convocação dos Braços, e os Braços obrigão a aceitar a Coroa. Effeitos
daquella Causa, e que sendo bons, Sanctificão o seu Principio. E que
houve neste Principio? _Petição_, e não Acclamação: tranquillidade, e
regosijo publico. Que houve nos Seculos XIV., e XVII.? mortes no
Palacio, mortes nas ruas, hum Arcebispo da Torre abaixo, _Acclamação_ em
todo o caso, &c. e tudo valeo!!

Se se dá questão na Legitimidade, quem tinha a parte duvidosa ainda hoje
não se dá por vencido; mas, os que não a tinhão não precisavão Conselho:
e quem será mais em direito, os Procuradores, ou os Constituintes? Os
Constituintes fallárão, e escrevêrão. (Veja-se o que proclamárão os
Póvos, e o que escrevêrão os dignos Tribunaes, e todas as Classes)
Também depois fallárão, e escrevêrão os Procuradores: melhor he, que
todos fallassem, e escrevessem, por que he duplicar o que já estava
expressado destinctamente; mas não he fazer mais valido o Procurador,
que o Constituinte. A incomparavel Obra = D. MIGUEL PRIMEIRO = a pag.
51 diz «Ha em Portugal duas fórmas, _igualmente legaes_, de reconhecer
os Soberanos: por Acclamação, e Proclamação, ou em Côrtes.» e quem
deixa de respeitar esta insigne Obra? O zeloso, e circunspecto
Intendente Geral da Policia até repartio os seus Exemplares.

Como se ha de exprimir o Povo? será nos Clubs secretos da Maçonaria, ou
no Campo, como em momentos semelhantes, (e só em taes momentos licito) a
respeito do 1.º Affonso, e do 1.º, e 4.° João? Aquella mesma inimitavel
Obra conclue «As Côrtes, por tanto, legitimamente convocadas pelo Senhor
D. MIGUEL PRIMEIRO, e a _rogos da Nação_, _exprimida_ nas Representações
das _Camaras Municipaes_ do Reino, e dos _Corpos do Estado_, decidirão
&c.» _Note-se_: Os Corpos do Estado, ainda que desejavão fallar, sómente
fallárão depois do Senado de Lisboa: as outras Camaras, fallárão pelo
grito publico dos Povos: O Senado veio a representar por effeito de
igual grito de Lealdade no Memoravel Dia 25 de Abril: Logo; se o Facto
honroso deste Dia decidio o Senado de Lisboa; se este foi o que entrou a
EL-REY, a que se seguirão nos dias immediatos aquelles dignos Corpos do
Estado, e se _a estes rogos_ he que forão convocadas as Côrtes; não
póde deixar de ter decorosa primasia huma Causa de que partirão taes
Effeitos, e Effeitos, que pela sua dependencia bem provão a necessidade
da sua Causa. Ou (por outro modo) Lisboa em silencio, o Senado mudo:
mudo o Senado de Lisboa, guardadas as Representações das outras Camaras:
nada por tanto de Representações dos Corpos do Estado; nada de
Convocação de Côrtes, e por consequencia nada de Acclamação.... e os
Tribunaes trabalhando, involuntariamente, debaixo do Titulo de hum Rey,
que a Nação em geral não admittia. Que anarchicas consequencias!! que
anomalias!!


Portanto:

Ou se _inveja_ a Causa, ou se _aborrecem_ os effeitos; e he de hum
destes Sentimentos, que só parte a desapprovação de Actos, que fizerão
vulto, e muito excedèrão, nos Seculos 12, 14, e 17, e o ficárão sempre
fazendo, como este deve fazer na Historia do nosso Paiz.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
